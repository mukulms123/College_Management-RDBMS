## ABSTRACT

    An organized and systematic office solution is essential for all universities and organizations. There are many departments of
    administration for the maintenance of college information and student databases in any institution. All these departments provide
    various records regarding students. Most of these track records need to maintain information about the students. This information
    could be the general details like student name, address, performance, attendance etc or specific information related to departments
    like collection of data.
    All the modules in college administration are interdependent. They are maintained manually. So they need to be automated and
    centralized as, Information from one module will be needed by other modules. For example when a student needs his course completion
    certificate it needs to check many details about the student like his name, reg number, year of study, exams he attended and many
    other details. So it needs to contact all the modules that are office, department and examination and result of students.
